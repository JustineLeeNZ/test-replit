# Instructions  

  ** Print out the message Hello world! **

  _ In this activity you practice using the print() function _

  ## Overview
  In Python, functions will have parentheses after them. A common function is print()
  You can pass information into a function by entering it inside the parentheses. This information is called an argument.
  
  For example, here we pass the number 15 into the print() function
```python
print(15)
```
When printing a string (text), you must enter speech marks around the content.
```python
print("This is Python")
```

## The task
Your task is to print the text: Hello world!
